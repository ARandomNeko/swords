## üîπ Problem Statement (Wildcard Innovation -- Track 4)

Most hackathon projects fall into productivity, sustainability, or
accessibility domains.\
We wanted to create something **fun, interactive, and visually
striking** that showcases real-time computer vision.

**Our idea:**\
A **camera-based sword fighting game** where players use **PVC pipes as
swords**.\
The system detects their movements, awards points when hits land, and
declares a winner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîπ Solution Overview

-   **Input:** Camera feed of two players fighting with PVC swords.\
-   **Processing:**
    -   Body & joint detection using **MediaPipe Pose** (fallback:
        DensePose).\
    -   Sword tip detection via **wrist tracking** or **colored marker
        on PVC tip** (OpenCV).\
    -   Collision detection between sword tip and opponent's body zones
        (head/torso).\
    -   Score updates + cooldown to avoid multiple hits per swing.\
-   **Output:**
    -   Live camera feed with overlays (skeleton, sword tips, flashes on
        hit).\
    -   Real-time scoreboard.\
    -   Winner announcement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîπ Technical Approach

### Components

1.  **Computer Vision (Development):**
    -   MediaPipe for real-time skeleton detection.\
    -   OpenCV for color detection of PVC sword tips.\
    -   Collision detection logic in Python.
2.  **Game Logic (Development):**
    -   Hit zones (head, torso).\
    -   Point system (best of 3 / time-based).\
    -   Live scoreboard overlay.
3.  **Testing & Hardware (Robotics/Hardware):**
    -   PVC pipes with colored tape as swords.\
    -   Camera setup in hackathon room.\
    -   Testing hit accuracy + gameplay rules.
4.  **Research (Research role):**
    -   Explored DensePose vs MediaPipe trade-offs.\
    -   Chose MediaPipe for speed + hackathon feasibility.\
    -   Studied simple collision models for hit detection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîπ Challenges Faced

-   Balancing **accuracy vs real-time speed** (DensePose too heavy,
    fallback to MediaPipe).\
-   Detecting PVC pipes reliably ‚Üí solved with **color marker**.\
-   Preventing duplicate hits ‚Üí solved with **cooldown timer**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîπ Future Improvements

-   Add **multiple hit zones** (arms, legs).\
-   Use **3D pose estimation** for more realistic sword tracking.\
-   Turn into a **full AR sword-fighting game** with virtual swords +
    effects.\
-   Multiplayer networked version (remote sword fights).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîπ Demo Instructions

1.  Stand two players in front of camera with PVC swords.\
2.  Start the program ‚Üí live feed with overlays appears.\
3.  Players swing swords ‚Üí hits flash + points scored.\
4.  System announces winner after 30s or 3 points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîπ Conclusion

Our project, **PVC Sword Fighting Game**, reimagines hackathon
creativity by turning real-life motion into a fun, interactive computer
vision experience.\
It demonstrates **real-time body tracking, game logic, and visual
overlays** -- showing both technical execution and entertainment value.
